  abstract = {Person re-identification (re-ID) and attribute recognition share a common target at learning pedestrian descriptions. Their difference consists in the granularity. Most existing re-ID methods only take identity labels of pedestrians into consideration. However, we find the attributes, containing detailed local descriptions, are beneficial in allowing the re-ID model to learn more discriminative feature representations. In this paper, based on the complementarity of attribute labels and ID labels, we propose an attribute-person recognition (APR) network, a multi-task network which learns a re-ID embedding and at the same time predicts pedestrian attributes. We manually annotate attribute labels for two large-scale re-ID datasets, and systematically investigate how person re-ID and attribute recognition benefit from each other. In addition, we re-weight the attribute predictions considering the dependencies and correlations among the attributes. The experimental results on two large-scale re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that by learning a more discriminative representation, APR achieves competitive re-ID performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We use APR to speed up the retrieval process by ten times with a minor accuracy drop of 2.92% on Market-1501. Besides, we also apply APR on the attribute recognition task and demonstrate improvement over the baselines.}

  abstract  = {Re-identification of persons is usually based on primary biometric features such as their faces, fingerprints, iris or gait. However, in most existing video surveillance systems, it is difficult to obtain these features due to the low resolution of surveillance footages and unconstrained real-world environments. As a result, most of the existing person re-identification techniques only focus on overall visual appearance. Recently, the use of soft biometrics has been proposed to improve the performance of person re-identification. Soft biometrics such as height, gender, age are physical or behavioural features, which can be described by humans. These features can be obtained from low-resolution videos at a distance ideal for person re-identification application. In addition, soft biometrics are traits for describing an individual with human-understandable labels. It allows human verbal descriptions to be used in the person re-identification or person retrieval systems. In some deep learning based person re-identification methods, soft biometrics attributes are integrated into the network to boot the robustness of the feature representation. Biometrics can also be utilised as a domain adaptation bridge for addressing the cross-dataset person re-identification problem. This chapter will review the state-of-the-art deep learning methods involving soft biometrics from three perspectives: supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches. In the end, we discuss the existing issues that are not addressed by current works.},
